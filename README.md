A demo of the vibe-coded thesis allocation system of [the other repository folder](https://github.com/costis-t/vibe_coding_projects/tree/main/Cursor/thesis_allocation_algorithms_and_dashboard) so it can show basic functionality at (thesis-allocation-system.streamlit.app)[https://thesis-allocation-system.streamlit.app/].
Some graph generation and downloading do not run correctly at the (Streamlit app)[https://thesis-allocation-system.streamlit.app/], but run fine locally.
